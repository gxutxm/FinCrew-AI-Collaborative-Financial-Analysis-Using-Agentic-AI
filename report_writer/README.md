### Repository Notes

This repository intentionally excludes auto-generated and local
environment files such as:

- Python virtual environments (`venv/`, `.venv/`)
- Python cache files (`__pycache__/`, `*.pyc`)
- Editor configuration folders (e.g., `.vscode/`)
- OS-specific files (e.g., `.DS_Store`)
- Generated outputs (PDFs, images, logs)

These files are excluded via `.gitignore` to ensure the repository
contains only source code and configuration required to reproduce
results.
